reviews:
  - author: Alessandro
    content: "Style-wise, with its interiors resembling those of an apothecary, Ben Fiddich is as evokative as any bar can be. Unfortunately, its cocktails did not quite lived to the hype. Old fashioned: unbalanced. Pear-based cocktail: too weak. Final score: good but no great."

    content: "The door opened into a fantasy world: deer stare at you from the walls, rabbits step through windows, bramble obscures fellow adventurers. We sat next to Cloud, Tifa and Barrett, and ordered some Megalixirs. Sadly all we got were potions."
