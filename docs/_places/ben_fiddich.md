  - author: Alessandro
    content: "Style-wise, with its interiors resembling those of an apothecary, Ben Fiddich is as evokative as any bar can be. Unfortunately, its cocktails did not quite lived to the hype. Old fashioned: unbalanced. Pear-based cocktail: too weak. Final score: good but no great."
