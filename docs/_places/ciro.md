    content: Outside of Italy, pizza can be broadly categorised as stuff that you should be arrested for, incredible for having been prepared abroad and okay. This pizza was okay.

    content: Good Neapolitan-style margherita and marinara, at Â¥1500 in total arguably the best value for money in Tokyo so far. (No members of the staff were killed for having a French fries pizza on the menu to write this review.)
