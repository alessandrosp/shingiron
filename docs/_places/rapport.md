    content: Music: very good. Interior design: good. Service: average. Drinks: bad. The fact you can still smoke inside: very bad. Uninspired and thus uninspiring, this bar is as meh as any place can get.

    content: Claimed to be closed and was open. Claimed to have mixed nuts and did. Claimed to know how to make cocktails and didn’t.
