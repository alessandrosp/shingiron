      Ranked 72th on the list of Asia's 50 Best Bars 2021, this gem of a bar is powered by the creativity of Mr. and Mrs. Miyanohara. Drinks are conceived from single seasonal fruits (a trend they helped kick-starting) and presented in the most eccentric way. Highly recommended.

      Japan in a nutshell: walk down a random street, get into a random lift, go up to a random floor, enter a random door, sit down and enjoy the weirdest, freshest, most beautifully crafted fruit cocktails of your life.
