<h1>Sakura-Shinmachi</h1>

Sakura-Shinmachi is a section of the city that lives half in pop-culture fame, half in scenes of everyday suburban life. It’s an understated stop along the Tokyu Den-en-toshi Line in Setagaya Ward, a neighborhood that — with its appealing name and connection to the long-running Sazae–san manga series — offers visitors more than just cherry blossoms in springtime.
